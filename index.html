                    <h3>Induction Coil</h3>
                    <p>Starting in the summer of 2012, Tim and Austin will begin work creating an induction heating coil. By applying concepts studied in first year ECE, they hope to create a smaller, proof-of-concept device which can then be scaled up to a larger induction heater.</p>
                    <p>One application considered for such a device is for hard-drive destruction. Hard drives are primarily metal, and very suceptible to magnetic fields. The induction heater could be used to wipe data from the disk, or potentially melt the data storage layer in the disk itself.</p>

                    <h3>Homemade Transistors</h3>
                    <p>Starting in the summer of 2012, Tim and Austin will begin work creating transistors from silicon wafers. Utilizing home-built devices and commerically available products, they intend to build proof-of-concept transistors which are suitable for use in logic circuits or amplifiers, such as in a transistor radio.</p>
                    <p>Their task will involve finding a suitable kiln, as the process required to impregnate the silicone requires extremely high temperatures, as well as aquiring powerful acids to etch layers into the wafers.</p>

                    <p>Starting in the summer of 2012, Stuart and Tim will begin work on an autonomous Quadrotor system. Its goal is to attempt to replicate advanced movements seen in other quadrotor experiment facilities, such as the one at the University of Pensylvania, but without the need for a large, custom built, IR sense space.</p>
                    <p>Utilizing a Microsoft Kinect device, SLAM algorithms will be used to generate 3D maps of the environment suitable for navigation purposes. The quadrotor will make use of ROS, the Robotics Operating System.</p>

           <h1>About Waterloo Maker Group</h1>
		   <p>Waterloo Maker Group was founded by Austin Cousineau, Tim Vieregge and Stuart Alldritt during the Spring of 2012. With a co-op work term comming up, they all had many ideas for projects they wanted to do over the summer. They realized that their projects were all interesting enough that other people might want to know more about them. To that end, they formed this group and website, The Waterloo Maker Group, to host information about themselves and their projects. Each project has a blog, gallery, and Git repository, where project progress is stored centrally. Members of the group have profile pages which are kept updated with contact information and biographies.</p>
           
		   <h1>About this website</h1>
		   <p>This website is intended to be a central location for all information about Waterloo Maker Group. You can find out about the history of the members and contact information in <a href="./bio.html">Profiles</a>. All our current projects, or projects that are currently in the planning phase, can be found under the projects portal. Each project is hosted in its own GitHub repository, as are the web-pages that support it. Throughout the site, links back to relevant GitHub pages are included when necessary. Our main GitHub account is <a href="http://github.com/uwmakers">here</a>.</p>
