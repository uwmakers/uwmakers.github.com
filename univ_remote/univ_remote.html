		<h1>First post!</h1>
		<p>Today is my first day in the new house. Finally got all my stuff unpacked, and I'm settled in. I thought it would be good to write the fist entry in the blog for this project.</p>
		<p>This all started when I became frustrated that there was no good way of interfacing my media PC with my stereo system and TV. These aren't top of the line systems here, so there is no intercommunication protocol. I'd often considered using a universal remote, but they don't work properly all the time and are expensive. I wanted something hackable.</p>
		<p>I quickly decided on using a touchscreen OLED: I wanted this to look nice after all, and the form factor I was imagining was about GPS size. I wanted this to be as compatible as possible: that means it has to support a lot of communication protocols, give you the ability to reprogram the way it works, writing code if need be, and it needs to work CONSISTENTLY. My current plan involves a ribon of IR LED's around the outside of the unit, with a BlueTooth module and Wifi card inside to give it as much intercommunication as possible. Right now, its looking like I'm going to get an ARM processor to do this, and I might consider putting a heavily modified version of Android on here if it suits me.</p>
		<p>From this I can quickly see some project requirements.
		<ul>
			<li>The system must be the same form factor as a car GPS</li>
			<li>The system must be compatible with as many different devices as possible, which means using many different protocols</li>
			<li>The system must be stable and consistently control all devices it is attached to</li>
			<li>The system must be expandable: it must contain a way for users to input code directly into the device if necessary to program behaviour, but also have very good code searching algorithms</li>
		</ul>
		I haven't drawn up a schematic for this yet, but these are just my initial thoughts. I might make something a bit more concrete in future.</p>
